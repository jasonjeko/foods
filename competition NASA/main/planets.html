            <h1 class="namess">Mars</h1>
            <!-- <img src="C:\Users\moeme\Desktop\New folder\NASA_logo.svg.png"> -->
            <div class="div">
                Namesake
                Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of
                blood. Other civilizations also named the planet for this attribute – for example, the Egyptians called
                it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one." Even today, it is frequently called the
                "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look
                red.

                Potential for Life
                Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're looking for
                signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.

                Size and Distance
                With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the
                size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.

                From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units
                away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.
                From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.

                Orbit and Rotation
                As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on
                Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols – short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 669.6
                sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.

                Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This
                is another similarity with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has distinct
                seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun
                (because it's farther away). And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the year,
                lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of Mars'
                elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun.

                Spring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols. Autumn in
                the northern hemisphere (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days. Northern winter/southern
                summer is 154 sols, and northern summer/southern winter is 178 sols.

                Moons
                Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids. They're potato-shaped
                because they have too little mass for gravity to make them spherical.

                The moons get their names from the horses that pulled the chariot of the Greek god of war, Ares.

            <div class="div">
                Introduction
                Jupiter's signature stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in
                an atmosphere
                of hydrogen and helium.
                The dark orange stripes are called belts,
                while the lighter bands are called zones, and they flow east and west in opposite directions. Jupiter’s
                iconic Great Red
                Spot
                is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

                The king of planets was named for Jupiter, king of the gods in Roman mythology.
                Most of its moons are also named for mythological characters, figures associated with Jupiter or his
                Greek counterpart,
                Zeus.

                Namesake
                Jupiter, being the biggest planet, gets its name from the king of the ancient Roman gods.

                Potential for Life
                Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures,
                and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to
                adapt to.

                While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some
                of its many
                moons.
                Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar system. There is evidence of a
                vast ocean just
                beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly be supported.

                Size and Distance
                With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were
                the size of a
                grape, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.

                From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical
                units away from the
                Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU),
                is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 43 minutes to travel from
                the Sun to
                Jupiter.

            <div class="div">
                Introduction
                Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is
                not
                the only planet to have rings,
                but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons.

                From the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan,
                the Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries.

                Namesake
                The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient
                times.
                The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the father of Jupiter.

                Potential for Life
                Saturn's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures,
                and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to
                adapt
                to.

                While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of
                its
                many moons.
                Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could possibly support life.

                Size and Distance
                With an equatorial diameter of about 74,897 miles (120,500 kilometers), Saturn is 9 times wider than
                Earth.
                If Earth were the size of a nickel,
                Saturn would be about as big as a volleyball.

                From an average distance of 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers), Saturn is 9.5 astronomical units
                away from the Sun.
                One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it
                takes sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the Sun to Saturn.
                Orbit and Rotation
                Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system. One day on Saturn takes only 10.7 hours (the
                time it
                takes for Saturn to rotate or spin around once),
                and Saturn makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Saturnian time) in about 29.4 Earth years
                (10,756 Earth days).

                Its axis is tilted by 26.73 degrees with respect to its orbit around the Sun, which is similar to
                Earth's
                23.5-degree tilt.
                This means that, like Earth, Saturn experiences seasons.

                Moons
                Saturn is home to a vast array of intriguing and unique worlds. From the haze-shrouded surface of Titan
                to
                crater-riddled Phoebe,
                each of Saturn's moons tells another piece of the story surrounding the Saturn system. As of June 8,
                2023,
                Saturn has 146 moons in its orbit,
                with others continually awaiting confirmation of their discovery and official naming by the
                International
                Astronomical Union (IAU).

            <div class="div">
                Introduction
                Uranus is a very cold and windy world. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 28 small moons.
                Uranus rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus
                appear
                to spin sideways,
                orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.

                Uranus was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope. It was discovered in 1781 by astronomer
                William Herschel,
                although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two years later that the object
                was
                universally accepted as a new planet,
                in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode.

                Namesake
                William Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III.
                Instead,
                the planet was named for Uranus,
                the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode.

                Potential for Life
                Uranus' environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures,
                and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to
                adapt
                to.

                Size and Distance
                With an equatorial diameter of 31,763 miles (51,118 kilometers), Uranus is four times wider than Earth.
                If Earth was the size of a nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball.

                From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is about 19 astronomical
                units away from the Sun.
                One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance,
                it takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus.

                Orbit and Rotation
                One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours. This is the amount of time it takes Uranus to rotate, or spin
                once
                around its axis.
                Uranus makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Uranian time) in about 84 Earth years (30,687
                Earth
                days).

                Uranus is the only planet whose equator is nearly at a right angle to its orbit, with a tilt of 97.77
                degrees.
                This may be the result of a collision with an Earth-sized object long ago.
                This unique tilt causes Uranus to have the most extreme seasons in the solar system. For nearly a
                quarter of
                each Uranian year,
                the Sun shines directly over each pole, plunging the other half of the planet into a 21-year-long, dark
                winter.

                Uranus is also one of just two planets that rotate in the opposite direction than most of the planets.
                Venus
                is the other.

                Moons
                Uranus has 28 known moons. While most of the satellites orbiting other planets take their names from
                Greek
                or Roman mythology,
                Uranus' moons are unique in being named for characters from the works of William Shakespeare and
                Alexander
                Pope.

                All of Uranus' inner moons appear to be roughly half water ice and half rock. The composition of the
                outer
                moons remains unknown,
                but they are likely captured asteroids.

                Rings
                Uranus has two sets of rings. The inner system of nine rings consists mostly of narrow, dark grey rings.
                There are two outer rings: the innermost one is reddish like dusty rings elsewhere in the solar system,
                and the outer ring is blue like Saturn's E ring.

                In order of increasing distance from the planet, the rings are called Zeta, 6, 5, 4, Alpha, Beta, Eta,
                Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Epsilon, Nu, and Mu.
                Some of the larger rings are surrounded by belts of fine dust.

                Introduction
                Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is more than 30 times as far from the Sun
                as
                Earth.

                Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye. In 2011 Neptune completed
                its
                first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.

                Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us.
                The warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.

                Namesake
                The ice giant Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical calculations. Using predictions
                made
                by Urbain Le Verrier,
                Johann Galle discovered the planet in 1846. The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea, as
                suggested
                by Le Verrier.

                Potential for Life
                Neptune's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials
                that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme,
                and volatile for organisms to adapt to.

                Size and Distance
                With an equatorial diameter of 30,775 miles (49,528 kilometers), Neptune is about four times wider than
                Earth.
                If Earth were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be about as big as a baseball.

                From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers), Neptune is 30 astronomical units
                away from the Sun.
                One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance,
                it takes sunlight 4 hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune.
                Orbit and Rotation
                One day on Neptune takes about 16 hours (the time it takes for Neptune to rotate or spin once).
                And Neptune makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Neptunian time) in about 165 Earth years
                (60,190 Earth days).

                Sometimes Neptune is even farther from the Sun than dwarf planet Pluto. Pluto's highly eccentric,
                oval-shaped orbit brings it inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period every 248 Earth years. This
                switch,
                in which Pluto is closer to the Sun than Neptune, happened most recently from 1979 to 1999. Pluto can
                never
                crash into Neptune, though,
                because for every three laps Neptune takes around the Sun, Pluto makes two. This repeating pattern
                prevents
                close approaches of the two bodies.

                Neptune’s axis of rotation is tilted 28 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun,
                which is similar to the axial tilts of Mars and Earth. This means that Neptune experiences seasons just
                like
                we do on Earth; however,
                since its year is so long, each of the four seasons lasts for over 40 years.
                Moons
                Neptune has 16 known moons. Neptune's largest moon Triton was discovered on Oct. 10, 1846, by William
                Lassell,
                just 17 days after Johann Gottfried Galle discovered the planet. Since Neptune was named for the Roman
                god
                of the sea,
                its moons are named for various lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.

                Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that circles its planet in a direction opposite to the
                planet's rotation (a retrograde orbit),
                which suggests that it may once have been an independent object that Neptune captured. Triton is
                extremely
                cold, with surface temperatures around minus 391 degrees
                Fahrenheit (minus 235 degrees Celsius). And yet, despite this deep freeze at Triton, Voyager 2
                discovered
                geysers spewing icy material upward more than 5 miles (8 kilometers). Triton's thin atmosphere,
                also discovered by Voyager, has been detected from Earth several times since, and is growing warmer, but
                scientists do not yet know why.

                Rings
                Neptune has at least five main rings and four prominent ring arcs that we know of so far. Starting near
                the
                planet and moving outward,
                the main rings are named Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago, and Adams. The rings are thought to be
                relatively
                young and short-lived.
